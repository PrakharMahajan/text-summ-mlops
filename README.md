# text-summ-mlops
Text summarization, a core NLP task, creates concise summaries. My project combines advanced NLP with MLOps for efficient summarization. This fusion optimizes linguistic understanding, model deployment, and management in a condensed, accessible form.

For this project, you need run the main files present on the master branch. 

The files present inside the "test" folder are all the codes, that were used to testing, and some of them did not worked. The final code files are present on the master branch, and be used for model training and testing.

Also, the used needs to create several folders, such as 

1. Clean Dataset - to keep the clean, pre-processed datset
2. cnn_dailymail - to keep the cnn dailymail dataset
3. dataset - to keep the combined datasets (uncleaned)
4. untouched_dataset - a copy of datasets in case of any error

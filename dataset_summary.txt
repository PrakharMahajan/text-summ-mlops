I am going to use 3 datasets for training the summarization model.

1. CNN/Daily Mail Dataset
2. New York Times Annotated Corpus
3. XSum Dataset

The CNN/Daily Mail dataset can be downloaded manually from Kaggle.
The complete dataset can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail/data
